# ruby_mastermind

As part of my progress through The Odin Project's Ruby course, I have built a Mastermind game. During this game the player can:
- Decide whether they want to be the code BREAKER or code MAKER
- If the player decides to be the code BREAKER, the computer sets a random four-digit code and the player has 12 goes to guess the code correctly
- To help in determining the code, the game will indicate whether each digit in the player's guess is a correct number and in the correct place
- If the player decides to be the code MAKER, the user will input their chosen four-digit code
- The computer then uses the Donald Knuth Mastermind-Five-Guess-Algorithm to determine the code.

In future I would like to explore ways to make this algorithm run faster.
